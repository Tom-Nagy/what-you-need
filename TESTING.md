## Code Validation

All code validation has been done using text input. The code was copied from the source code of the browser inspect page. This allows to check HTML without getting error because of Jinja template.

### W3C

W3C Markup Validation Service and W3C CSS Validation Service have been used to check all the pages of the website for semantic and syntax errors.
The results show no errors and the code is valid.

* [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

* [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
  * ![W3C CSS Validation Result](app/static/images/README-images/TESTING-images/code-validation/css-validator.png)

[**:back:** *Table of Content*](#Table-of-Content)

### JSHint

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the JavaScript code for semantic and syntax errors. No warnings or error were found.  
The results are positive, and the code is valid.

### PEP8

[PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com/) was used to validate the Python code for semantic and syntax errors. No warnings or error were found.  
The results are positive, and the code is valid.

Exception:  
one line of code is too long and correspond to the regex pattern variable for password validation.

### Regex

[Regex101](https://regex101.com/) to check implementation of regex pattern.

## Lighthouse

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/?utm_source=devtools) is a tool provided by Google Chrome DevTools and allows to identify the site performance, accessibility and user experience on Mobile and Desktop.  
All the pages from the website have been tested with Lighthouse.

* The scores given by Lighthouse for:

  * **SEO** (Search Engine Optimization) show **Crawling and Indexing** issues with invalid robots.txt file. I have done some research but found the subject out of scope and myself in the complete dark, running out of time I decided to leave it the way it is.

  * **Accessibility** show issues regarding contrast. Those apply to some material icons that are only esthetic element and provide no information to the user. ``aria-hidden="true"`` has been added to those elements

  * **Accessibility** show issue regarding form label. This is raised by the fact that Materializecss used javascript to change the ``select`` tag to an input that does not have a corresponding label. So error is shown even though the select tag has a corresponding label. As well the date and time input have a default label and therefor through an error.

  * **Best Practice** show issues regarding image size and more precisely the favicon size expectation against the size produced on the website. Even after changing to the expected size shown by the error, the issue still exist with different sizes. This is not a major issue and I decided to leave it that way at the moment.

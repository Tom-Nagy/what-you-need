### Design Choices

The approach concerning design choices is that the UX (User experience) should be the same across all platform and devices. Consistency being a key factor for UX.  
For this reason the UI (User Interface) is kept the same across different device sizes. This does not exclude the consideration for any extra or different features, should it improve the user experience.

#### Fonts

Considering the targeted audience, the sans serif type of font is the more appropriate because it is most often associated with simplicity and straightforwardness.  

The website will use well known and popular font that are used online in order to bring to the user a "feeling of knowing".

* *Poppins* for headings.

* *Lato* for main content.

*Sans serif* will be use as a fall back if the fonts do not load. It is common as the main typographies are sans serif type.

#### Icons

* Some Font Awesome icons will be part of the website for better UX.
* The [logo](documentation/logo/logo.png) and [favicon](documentation/favicon/favicon.ico) are the same image and use the color scheme of the website.

![logo](documentation/logo/logo.png)

#### Colors

![Color palette](documentation/colour-scheme/colours-theme.png)

The colours chosen for the website are simple and joyful. They are based on the psychology behind colours ([colour affects](http://www.colour-affects.co.uk/psychological-properties-of-colours), [London Image Institute](https://londonimageinstitute.com/how-to-empower-yourself-with-color-psychology/)).

[Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com) was used to build the colour scheme, compatibility and accessibility. The color scheme and swatches are said color-blind safe.

![Color accessibility](documentation/colour-scheme/colours-accessibility.png)

#### Images

The images will be the one uploaded by website owner and/or Admin for products descriptions and website illustrations.  

MAYBE IMAGES WILL BE UPLOADED USING A DATA FROM A WEBSITE 111111111111111111

#### Styling/Feeling

The feel of the website is welcoming and simple to provide a quick access and learning process.  
It makes users comfortable.

#### Audio/Video

No audio or video will be integrated at the moment.

### Different design

After considering deadline and features priority, I decided to leave the support section for future features to implement. I once heard that the project is never finished, we just run out of time!

[**:back:** *Table of Content*](#Table-of-Content)

## Flowchart

[**:back:** *Table of Content*](#Table-of-Content)

## Database

### Database design

The database design used is a relational database.

* During **development**, sqlite3 was used. It is the database provided by Django and only use for development.
* For **Production**, Postgres is used. It is the database provided by Heroku when deploying the website live.

Below is a representation of the database used for this project.
![Database Design](documentation/data-design/database-design.png)

### Database Structure

Django, the framework used for the production of this project, is an MVP: Model View Product/Project ??????? This means that the project build with Django is divided in multiple apps. Its structure allows separation of concern and provide many built-in features.  
The models define the data-structure.

* In this project, the following models have been developed:
  * Product
  * Category
  * Order
  * OrderLineItem
  * OrderIssue
  * User
  * UserAccount
  * Review
They can be grouped into three main models : Product, Order, UserAccount

* Models relationship:
  * Product :left_right_arrow: Category: **Many to Many**
    * A Product can be related to many Category, and a Category can be related to many Product.
  
  * Product :left_right_arrow: OrderLineItem: **Many to One**
    * A Product can be related to many OrderLineItem, but an OrderLineItem can be related to one Product.
  
  * Product :left_right_arrow: Review: **Many to One**
    * A Product can be related to many Review, but a Review can be related to one Product.
  
  * Order :left_right_arrow: UserAccount: **One to Many**
    * A Order can be related to one UserAccount, but a UserAccount can be related to many Order.
  
  * Order :left_right_arrow: OrderLineItem: **Many to One**
    * An Order can be related to many OrderLineItem, but an OrderLineItem can be related to one Order.
  
  * Order :left_right_arrow: OrderIssue: **Many to One**
    * An Order can be related to many OrderIssue, but an OrderIssue can be related to one Order.
  
  * UserAccount :left_right_arrow: Review: **Many to One**
    * A UserAccount can be related to many Review, but a Review can be related to one UserAccount.
  
  * UserAccount :left_right_arrow: User: **One to One**
    * A UserAccount can be related to one User, and a User can be related to one UserAccount.
  
  * UserAccount :left_right_arrow: OrderIssue: **Many to One**
    * An UserAccount can be related to many OrderIssue, but an OrderIssue can be related to one UserAccount.
